## Description

This application is a full stack e-commerce app. I was tasked with cpompleting the previously unfinished api routes and sequelize models for the database, but was unable to debug the routes in sufficient time to demonstrate them all in insomnia successfully. The models, routes, associations have all been completed. The databse can seed successfully when the "npm run seed" command is entered into the command line.

I have included a video demonstrating this partial functionality, however time constraints have prevented me from including my route testing with insomnia in my walkthrough video. The repository link contains complted code for the models, routes, and server.
